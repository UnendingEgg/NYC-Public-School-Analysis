# NYC-Public-School-Analysis

## Description
Analysis of NYC public high school data using pandas, plotly express, and statsmodels to create data-driven visualizations.

This project explores demographic and socioeconomic patterns in New York City public high schools. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, I investigated relationships between student enrollment, disability status, English language learners, and poverty levels.

## Key Findings

1. Typical NYC high schools have 200–550 students enrolled.

2. Around 20% of students have disabilities.

3. 0–10% of students are English learners (ESL).

4. A striking 78–96% of students live in poverty.

5. A strong positive correlation exists between poverty and English learners, suggesting that students with limited English proficiency face disproportionate socioeconomic challenges.
